    "## Intro to AWS\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is far and away the largest provider of cloud compute infrastructure in the world. Learning how to interact with AWS is an extremely valuable and powerful tool to add to your belt.\n",
    "\n",
    "AWS can be thought of as a set of building blocks, with which you can build almost anything imaginable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile apps, personal websites, photo back up, â‚¿ mining, databases, data lakes, global IT infrastructure, and more can all be built using AWS. For most people, it is true to say that no day goes by without them interacting in one form or another with a service hosted on AWS. So household names that are built on AWS are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - Netflix\n",
    " - Reddit\n",
    " - Pinterest\n",
    " - AirBnb\n",
    " - State and local government\n",
    " - US Intelligence Agencies\n",
    " - and many, MANY more!\n",
    " \n",
    "The labs we'll work through here, will help you get your feet wet with the platform. There are an ever growing number of services, so we'll work through a few examples of how to interact with the AWS services, and then you'll get a chance later in the course to explore more on your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, there are three ways to interact with AWS services:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)\n",
    "    - Can be used directly from your command line\n",
    "- Boto3 (the official AWS SDK for Python)\n",
    "    - Used for integrating AWS services into Python code\n",
    "- The AWS Console (https://console.aws.amazon.com/)\n",
    "    - AWS website, where you can see all your services, and manually spin up services\n",
    "    \n",
    "We'll start with a number of Boto3 examples, then log into the console and try a few things, and finally give the CLI a shot.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the AWS labs you'll need:\n",
    " - Boto3 (python library)\n",
    " - awscli (python library)"
